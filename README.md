## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Will

I'm interested in reinforcement learning, natural language processing, trading & backtesting; especially the intersection of them all. I also enjoy sailing and built a semi-autonomous boat in the past.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- A trade backtesting engine for simulating the microstructure of exchanges, written in Rust :crab:.
- A reverse-mode auto-differentation engine, also written in Rust.
