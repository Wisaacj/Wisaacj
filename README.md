## Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Will

I'm interested in RL, NLP, Trading & Backtesting, especially the intersection of them all. I also enjoy sailing and have built a semi-autonomous boat in the past.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a trade backtesting engine that simulates the microstructure of exchanges, written in Rust.
