## Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Will

I'm interested in RL, NLP, Trading & Backtesting, especially the intersection of them all. I also enjoy sailing and have built a semi-autonomous boat in the past.

### ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- A trade backtesting engine for simulating the microstructure of exchanges, written in Rust.
- A reverse-mode auto-differentation engine, written in Rust.
